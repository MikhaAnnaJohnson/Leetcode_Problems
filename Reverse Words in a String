A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

class Solution {
public String reverseWords(String s) {
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
        // Split the string by spaces and remove extra spaces
        String[] strArray = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        int i = strArray.length - 1;
        
      
        while (i >= 0) {
            str.append(strArray[i]);
            if (i != 0) {
                str.append(" "); // Add space between words
            }
            i--;
        }
        return str.toString();
    }
}
